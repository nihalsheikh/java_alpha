# Operators

- Symbols that tells the compiler to perform some operation are Operators
    - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` 
    - Example: `sum = a + b`
        - this is called as an Expression
        - `a` and `b` here are called as Operands
        - `+` is called as an Operator
        - This operation is Addition
