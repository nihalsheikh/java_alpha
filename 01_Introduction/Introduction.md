### Pre-requisites

- [x] Code Editor
    - [x] VS Code (I'm using this >_<)
    - [x] Eclipse
    - [x] Install Java
    - [x] go to oracle to download latest version
    - [x] After installing, set the environmnet varibales

### Basics

- `.java` is the extension for java
- In the java file, the first MOST IMP thing to do is declare **class**.
- To write the code in java, we first declare a class.
- You should always REMEMBER that in JAVA the **`classname`** and **`filename`** should be same
- We define a function inside this class
- The code which we have to write again & again, or reuse it multiple time, is called **Boilerplate code**, It is like a template, like the one below in the example .

### Comments
**Single Line Comment**
        - use `//` double forward slash symbols.

**Multi Line Comment**
        - use `/* */`
        - example:
```
/*
this is multi line comment
*/
```


**Multiple Line Output:**
- Suppose you want to print multiple text, but in different line, type: **`println`**,*`ln`* here means next line.
- Another way to print the text in next line is to add: **`\n` backslash** after the text.

**Compiling**
- Before running the code, it should be compiled. In Java to compile code, write this in your terminal: **`javac <filename>.java`**
- We are calling the compiler here, remember to add the extension to above code, when compiling.
